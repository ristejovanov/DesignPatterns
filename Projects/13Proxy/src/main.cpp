// Proxy design pattern
// An interface for accessing a particular resource

//   Motivation
// exmple 
// You are calling foo.bar()
// This assumes that foo is in the same process as bar
// what if later on, you want to pull all Foo-relatted operation into a separate process
//				-can you avoiding changing your code
//Proxy to the rescue!
//				- same interface,entirely different behavior
//This is called a communication proxy
//				- Other types:logging,virtual, guarding


// PROXY definition
